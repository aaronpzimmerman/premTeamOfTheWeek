Description: Find the fantasy team of the week for any premier league season, including all permutations of formation and players.

1) Download the season(s) folder(s) you want to work with, bestPerWeek.py and requirements.txt.
2) Create a .venv and run requirements.txt (pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt)
3) Make sure you have the subfolder "Teams of the Week" under each season folder because that will be the location of your .csv containing all permutations of formation and player.
